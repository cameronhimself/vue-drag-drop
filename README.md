> ❗ Version 1.0.0 is out! This finally includes support for IE/Edge.  

> Note that this required skipping the native `transferData` event property entirely in favor of a global variable that maintains the current drag transfer info. This could theoretically break some extreme edge cases involving multiple drag events occurring simultaneously, but I think it's very unlikely, or maybe even impossible.

# Introduction

The Drag and Drop API is pretty jank. Here are a handful of annoying issues:

- Data transferred from a draggable element to a dropzone is only available in the dropzone's `drop` event. Want to take a look at the draggable's data during the `dragover` event? Say, to determine whether or not we can allow the drop? Sorry! No helpful UI feedback for your users!
- Got an object or an array you want to transfer between a draggable and a dropzone? Tough. Gotta serialize it. Say goodbye to your references.
- Did you remember to do `event.preventDefault()` on `dragover` for every element you want to be used as a dropzone?

And so on.

The goal of this package is to provide a simple, lightweight wrapper around the API so you don't have to fiddle with all that nonsense. There are [plenty of existing Vue components](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#drag-and-drop) that provide rich handling of drag and drop, usually between or among lists and with tons of bells and whistles. They're great, but sometimes you don't need all that business, or it even gets in the way.

Take a look at some examples to get started:

# Installation

```
npm install --save vue-drag-drop
```

## Default import

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import { Drag, Drop } from 'vue-drag-drop';

Vue.component('drag', Drag);
Vue.component('drop', Drop);
```

Or install both:

```javascript
import Vue from 'vue';
import VueDragDrop from 'vue-drag-drop';

Vue.use(VueDragDrop);
```

## Browser

```html
<script src="vue.js"></script>
<script src="vue-drag-drop/dist/vue-drag-drop.browser.js"></script>
```

The plugin should be auto-installed. If not, you can install it manually with the instructions below.

```javascript
Vue.component('drag', VueDragDrop.Drag)
Vue.component('drop', VueDragDrop.Drop)
```

Or install both:

```javascript
Vue.use(VueDragDrop)
```

# API

## Components

### `Drag`
A draggable element.

### `Drop`

An element onto which a `Drag` can be dropped. All `Drop` elements accept all `Drag` elements, unless you change the behavior in your application.

## Properties

The following properties apply to `Drag` components. `Drop` components don't receive any properties.

### `draggable`
**validation** `Boolean`  
**default**: `true`  
Whether or not the draggable is actually draggable. Useful if you need to disable it temporarily.

### `transfer-data`
**validation**: none  
**default**: `null`  
The data to be transmitted from the `Drag` to the `Drop` via events. This is passed through to every `Drop`-fired event.

### `effect-allowed`
**validation**: `null` or one of `['none', 'copy', 'copyLink', 'copyMove', 'link', 'linkMove', 'move', 'all', 'uninitialized']`  
**default**: `null`  
See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/effectAllowed.

### `drop-effect`
**validation**: `null` or one of `['copy', 'move', 'link', 'none']`  
**default**: `null`  
See https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/dropEffect.

### `image`
**validation**: `null`, `String`  
**default**: `null`  
A URL for an image to be used for the drag image instead of the default. If you'd like to use HTML for the drag image instead, use the `image` slot. More details in the Slots section of this documentation.

If both the `image` prop and `image` slot are present, the prop will be used and the slot will be ignored.

### `image-x-offset`, `image-y-offset`
**validation**: `Number`  
**default**: `0`, `0`  
By default, a custom drag image is positioned so that its top-left corner is anchored to the cursor. You can adjust that positioning with these values. 

The unit is pixels. If you want to center an element, you can do `:image-x-offset="item.width / 2" :image-y-offset="item.height / 2"`.

### `hide-image-html`
**validation**: `Boolean`  
**default**: `true`  
If the `Drag` `image` slot is used, toggle whether or not the HTML is rendered off-screen. See the `image` slot documentation for more details.

### `tag`
**validation** `String`
**default**: `div`
Drag or Drop element's wrapper, defaults to div.


## Events

All event are fired with the same arguments:

- `transferData` _any_  
This is the data set on the `Drag`'s `transferData` prop. It _is_ available on all  `Drop`-fired events, despite the official spec only permitting it on `drop`.

- `nativeEvent` [_`DragEvent`_](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DragEvent)  
The native browser event. Useful particularly for retrieving the [`dataTransfer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer) object, which is needed for handling [dropped files](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DataTransfer/files).

If you need to pass additional arguments in your event listener, the preferred method is to use the ES6 spread operator with `arguments`:

```vue
<drag @drag="myListener('foo', ...arguments)">Drag Me</drag>
```
```javascript
myListener(myArg, transferData, nativeEvent) {
  // myArg === 'foo'
}
```

If you don't have the spread operator in your environment, you can use a wrapping function:

```vue
<drag @drag="function(transferData, nativeEvent) { myListener('foo', transferData, nativeEvent) }">
  Drag Me
</drag>
```

### `dragstart`
**components:** _`Drag`_  
Fired once when dragging starts.

### `drag`
**components:** _`Drag`_  
Repeatedly fired for the entire duration of the drag operation.

### `dragenter`
**components:** _`Drag`_, _`Drop`_  
Fired once every time a `Drag` is dragged over a `Drop`.

### `dragover`
**components:** _`Drag`_, _`Drop`_  
Repeatedly fired while a `Drag` is over a `Drop`.

### `dragleave`
**components:** _`Drag`_, _`Drop`_  
Fired once every time a `Drag` leaves a `Drop`.

### `drop`
**components:** _`Drop`_   
Fired once when a `Drag` is dropped on a `Drop`.

### `dragend`
**components:** _`Drag`_  
Fired once when the drag operation is completed. Occurs after `drop`.

## Slots

### _default_
**components:** _`Drag`_, _`Drop`_  
**example**: `<drag>I am the default slot</drag>`  
**example**: `<drop>So am I</drop>`  
For `Drag`, the content that will be draggable. For `Drop`, the content over which a `Drag` can be dropped.

Note that this is a [scoped slot](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/components.html#Scoped-Slots). The scope contains a single key, `transferData`, which will contain exactly what you set in the `transferData` prop on the `Drag`. For `Drag` elements, this will be populated while a drag is in action, and for `Drop` elements, when a `Drag` is being dragged over. Checking for the `transferData` in the `Drop` scope is the simplest way to determine if a drag is in progress over it.

### `image`
**components:** _`Drag`_  
**example**: `<drag>Drag Me<template slot="image"><div>I'm being dragged!</div></template></drag>`  
The contents of this slot will be used as the drag image instead of the browser default. Since the spec likes to be annoying, this content has to be visible in order for it to show up as the drag image, so it's rendered off-screen for you using `position: fixed`. If you need this convenience turned off, or if you need to support a crummy browser that this doesn't work well with, you can set the `hideImageHtml` prop to `false`, which will prevent any additional styling being added. Just be aware that doing so will cause this content to appear inside the `Drag` element. It's up to you how to deal with it.

Multiple `image` slots do nothing; only the first will be used. If both the `image` prop and `image` slot are present, the prop will be used and the slot will be ignored.

# Plugin Development

## Installation

The first time you create or clone your plugin, you need to install the default dependencies:

```
npm install
```

## Watch and compile

This will run webpack in watching mode and output the compiled files in the `dist` folder.

```
npm run dev
```

## Use it in another project

While developing, you can follow the install instructions of your plugin and link it into the project that uses it.

In the plugin folder:

```
npm link
```

In the other project folder:

```
npm link vue-drag-drop
```

This will install it in the dependencies as a symlink, so that it gets any modifications made to the plugin.


## Manual build

This will build the plugin into the `dist` folder in production mode.

```
npm run build
```
